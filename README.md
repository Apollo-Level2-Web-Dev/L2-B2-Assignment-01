# **Assignment-1:Basic Problem Solving using TypeScript for Technocrats**

The assignment includes different problems for working with TypeScript, such as changing the types of data, making interfaces for objects, using classes and inheritance, checking types of objects, and dealing with different kinds of data structures. The goal of the solutions is to show how to solve problems using TypeScript in a straightforward and effective way while following good coding practices.

***Here are some problems. Solve any 7 of them.***

***Problem 1:***

Design a TypeScript function that takes a parameter of a union type (e.g., string | number). If it's a string, return its length. If it's a number, return the square of that number.

***Problem 2:***

Create an interface called Person with optional properties address and phone. The address property itself will be another object containing city and street properties. Implement a function named getAddressCity that takes an argument of type Person and returns the city from the address property of the Person object. Use optional chaining to prevent any type errors.

***Problem 3**:*

Create a type guard function `isCat` that checks if an object is an instance of a `Cat` class. If it does, the function says "yes, it's a cat." If it doesn't match, the function says "no, it's not a cat."

***Problem 4:***

You got a list that has numbers and words mixed together. Your job is to make a function that will take the list as an argument and return the resultant total by adding them up.

To solve this in TypeScript, you'll look at each thing in the list named mixedData, which looks like this: [1, 'two', 3, 'four', 5]. You'll go through the list, find the numbers, and add them together.

Every time you find a number in the list, you'll add it to a total. You'll start at zero and then keep adding the numbers you find. If no number is found in the list return 0. To make sure TypeScript knows these things are numbers, you'll use type assertions.

***Problem 5:***

Define two interfaces: Car with properties like make, model, and year, and Driver with properties like name and licenseNumber. Create a function that takes two objects of type Car and Driver and returns an object with the combined properties of both types.

***Problem 6:***

Write a TypeScript function that takes a parameter of type unknown and uses a type guard to check whether the parameter is an array of numbers. If it is, calculate the sum of the numbers and log it. If it's not, log an error message.

***Problem 7:***

Create a TypeScript function called **findFirstOccurrence** that accepts an array and a value to search for. Use **generics** to make the function work with arrays of any data type. Inside the function, find and return the index of the first occurrence of the value in the array. If the value is not found in the array, return -1 to indicate that. Create sample arrays of different data types (e.g., numbers, strings) and call the **findFirstOccurrence** function for each of them to display the results.

```tsx
// Example usage:

const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2];

const strings: string[] = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "apple"];

const targetNumber = 2;

const targetString = "cherry";

const indexInNumbers = findFirstOccurrence(numbers, targetNumber);

const indexInStrings = findFirstOccurrence(strings, targetString);

console.log(indexInNumbers); //output:Â  1

console.log(indexInStrings); //output: 2
```

***Problem 8:***

Create a TypeScript program that simulates a simple shopping cart. Define an interface **Product** with properties like name, price, and quantity. Implement a function that calculates the total cost of the items in the shopping cart. The function should take an array of **Product** objects as input and return the total cost.

**Interview Questions:**

1. What are some benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript in a project?
2. What is the purpose of the optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) operators in TypeScript, and how do they work? Provide an example for each
3. How do you handle asynchronous operations in TypeScript, and what are the advantages of using async/await over callbacks or Promises?.
4. How can you use TypeScript's enums, and what are their advantages?.
5. Explain the role of type guards in TypeScript and provide an example of a custom type guard.
6. Can you give an example of how to use "readonly" properties in TypeScript?
7. Explain what a union type is in TypeScript and provide an example of its usage.

**Instruction:**

- **Do not include comments regarding the problem numbers within the code.**
- **Solutions must be in a single file.**
- **Employ meaningful names for variables, methods, functions, and other elements within the code.**
- **Ensure that the solution provided is independent of any AI or machine-generated assistance, as per the set guidelines.**
- **Adhere to standard coding practices for readability and clarity.**
- **Do not replicate code from fellow students. Doing so will result in receiving a mark of 0.**
